### House Value Prediction in North Carolina



This project provides information about the data and machine learning tools used in our analysis. Our project aims to use predictive modeling, to project the value of a home over time using factors such as median household income, poverty rate and number of schools in any given Zip Code in the state of North Carolina.
Our Hypothesis:
If you were to compare multiple Zip Codes in North Carolina you would find that areas with a higher median household income and higher number of public schools would correlate with a higher median house value. Areas with a higher poverty rate will correlate with a lower median house value.
Limitations:
-Many factors to choose from but short amount of time to evaluate
-Difficult to find valuable/usable data
Why is this data valuable?
Buying a home or investing in a property can be one of the most expensive and important purchases in anyoneâ€™s lifetime. A lot of research goes into this process which means looking at the home value and the value of factors surrounding a home. Most home buyers are looking for a house that is not only valuable at the time of purchase but that will also appreciate over time. While real estate listing websites can be useful when searching for homes that fit what a home buyer is looking for, our goal is for users such as home buyers, real estate investors and real estate agents to be able to look at an area and see what the projected median house value will be and see if certain socio economic factors will have an effect on this.
